<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>

<p>Please note that Presenters announced early to speak at Divescapes Scuba Conference are subject to last minute travel and work emergencies. They are generously donating their time away from their busy schedules to share with us ... their stories, explorations, photos, videos - just for the cost of their travel, hotel, etc. So remember that Divescapes' Speaker list is subject to change (sometimes at the last moment) – please come back often for updates and additions to our exciting seminar & keynote speaker line up at Divescapes 2018.</p>
