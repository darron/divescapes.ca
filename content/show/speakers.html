<p>Becky Schott is a multiple Emmy Award-winning underwater cameraman, photographer, and accomplished technical diving Instructor whose work can be seen on major networks including National Geographic, Discovery Channel, and the Travel Channel. She is co-owner of Liquid Productions, Inc, specializing in capturing quality imagery in challenging environments. Her projects have taken her all over the globe from exploring virgin wrecks in over 300 feet of water in the Great Lakes, rappelling into caves in the jungle, filming under ice in the Arctic to diving cage-less with great white sharks.</p>

<p>Becky has dived in 4 of the Great Lakes and participated in projects helping to document shipwrecks in 3D for the National Park Service in Isle Royale National Park.  She has also participated in several exploration projects searching for new wrecks in Lake Huron and Lake Michigan. In 2011 she was worked with NOAA on a documentary called “Project Shiphunt” searching for shipwrecks with a group of high school students. They found the  Schooner M.F. MERRICK lost in 1889 and ETURA in over 300 feet of icy cold water off of Presque Isle Michigan. Becky was one of the first divers on both wrecks to film the exploration. The dives were cold, deep and very challenging. The use of Closed Circuit Rebreathers, mixed gases and experienced safety team were used to conduct the dives.  In June of 2015 Becky was invited to assist in the exploration of the Alice E. Wilds found by Shipwreck Explorers off of Milwaukee Michigan. The wreck also sits in over 300 feet of water and was extremely intact. Becky’s passion for the Great Lakes has only grown fiercer in the past few years and visiting more incredible sites and learning the history of these wrecks.</p>

<p>Becky is extremely passionate about sharing the underwater world with others both through her imagery or teaching someone to dive. She's been teaching scuba since 2000 and is an active technical diving instructor and rebreather instructor. In her spare time she’s participated in several exploration projects around the world that have earned her a place as a Fellow in the Explorers Club and in 2013 she was inducted into the Women Divers Hall of Fame.</p>
