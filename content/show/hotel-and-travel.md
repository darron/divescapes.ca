<h2>About Calgary</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Set dramatically between prairies and peaks, Calgary is a chic urban landscape surrounded by incomparable natural grandeur. It’s a place where you can relish the great outdoors by day and world class cuisine and entertainment by night. A place buzzing with innovative energy while embracing its rich western heritage.

Calgarians have a need for speed, like seeing chuckwagon teams pound madly towards the finish line or four guys in a bobsled zooming down a frozen track at 120 km/h (75 mph). The legacy of the 1988 Winter Olympics burns brightly, with top notch facilities where new Olympic hopefuls train for gold. Calgary’s is home to the Wild West spirit with the Calgary Stampede, The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth.

As a recently designated Cultural Capital of Canada, Calgary has come of age with a spectrum of arts and performing arts – theatre, music and dance. And there’s some serious culinary magic to be found in the restaurants and fine dining rooms around town.
