The Artificial Reef Society of British Columbia, ARSBC, is a registered charitable non-profit society based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Our mission is to create environmentally- and economically-sustainable "artificial reefs" in British Columbia and around the world for the protection of environmentally- and historically-sensitive marine habitat, and for the enjoyment of scuba divers.
