Brett Hemphill
Brett Hemphill has been exploring since he can remember. Having moved 5 times before the age of 12, including a year in the country of Japan, his desire to investigate his ever-changing childhood surroundings is what certainly molded him into the person he is today. Climbing everything that was climbable, searching every creek to its source, there never seemed to be enough to satisfy his curiosity. At the age of 14 he attended a youth dry cave excursion. While the others slept, Brett and two trip counselors managed to find a yet undiscovered section of the cave. This discovery, small as it may have been, stayed with Brett for many years.

During the early nineties, many cave divers throughout Florida believed undiscovered caves were all but a thing of the past. Using redundant no-mount and side-mount techniques Brett began to probe and explore every small spring and tidal vent within a fifty mile radius of his home in central Florida. After the discovery of several significant under water caves, Brett formed HYDRO GEO Environmental Research in 1994.  This group studied explored and documented several coastal under water caves in central Florida throughout the nineties bringing a new appreciation and awareness to anticline cave systems.

Realizing small under water caves could lead to large discoveries Brett adapted pre-existing designs from long time side-mount divers such as: Woody Jasper, Wes Skiles, Lamar Hires, and Mark Long, designing a very holistic side-mount configuration known as the ARMIDILLO. Brett has filmed and assisted in producing a series of short under-water cave documentaries including The National Association of Cave Diving's The Need for Training.

For over 20 years with the support and companionship of friends and team members alike, Brett Hemphill has assisted in exploring, mapping, and documenting some of the most unique underwater cave systems in the United States, including two of the deepest systems currently on record (Phantom Springs, Texas & Weeki Wachee Springs, Florida). Additional exploration and research locations includes; Bahamas, Cay Sal Banks, Dominican Republic & Yucatan Peninsula. He consults and speaks regularly on: cave conservancy, exploration and logistics, side-mount & re-breather configurations, designs and there usage in overhead environments. Brett lives in Florida, USA.
Brett Hemphill is currently the Director for Karst Underwater Research: www.karstunderwaterreasearch.org

Brett Hemphill of KARST Underwater Research will introduce you to the logistics and insights of exploring 2 of the deepest underwater caves in the United States: Phantom Springs Cave and Weeki Wachee ‚Äê Twin Dees Spring Cave

Nancy McGee
Nancy McGee is an explorer and underwater filmmaker. She is an adrenaline junky, seeking opportunities to film the unusual and unique. Her film subjects include Humboldt squid, tiger sharks, an oceanic swimming elephant, and numerous species of whales.
In 2000, Nancy began a seven-year partnership with Stan Waterman, five-time Emmy-award winning filmmaker. She managed Stan Waterman Productions, organized exotic dive travel, and assisted in the filming and post production of documentaries. Nancy's efforts preserved a number of Mr. Waterman's vintage films, which documented the early days of recreational scuba diving and created a baseline for the study of coral reefs.
Nancy films and conducts tours in many of the world's most exotic locations; some so remote the local natives have never before seen Western people. For her efforts as an explorer, Nancy was recently named as a Fellow in the esteemed Explorers Club for contributing to scientific knowledge in the field of geographical exploration. She produces, edits and films her own documentaries, each with a unique historical spin on culture and the marine ecosystem.
Nancy's credits include work for NBC, Universal Studios, and Discovery. She has written for a variety of dive journals and publications. Nancy is a frequent presenter to schools, clubs, and community service groups. She is a featured speaker and emcee for national and international dive shows and film festivals. Nancy is a member of the Ocean Artists Society, Platinum Pro 5000, and a 2008 inductee into the Women Divers' Hall of Fame & Explorer's Club.  Nancy calls Texas home.
From hand-fed tiger sharks to swimming elephants, Nancy McGee has witnessed and film an odd array of marine creatures and apex predators. Nancy will take us on a tour of weird, wild and wonderful around the world. And all of the locations being highlighted are for the everyday recreational diver. Join Nancy to find your next bucket list destination.

John Bantin
The aft decks of dive boats often ring loud with stories told about diving exploits. You'll have a few stories of your own. After 25 years directing films and taking photographs for the British advertising industry, followed by a further 21 years as Chief Correspondent and Technical Editor to Britain's best selling diving magazine (where he certainly made his presence felt within the diving industry), John Bantin has become something of a raconteur.

So when a large American publisher asked him to write a book composed of short stories about diving, he felt he was well-placed. He tells what it took to write the book of 60 such stories, Amazing Diving Stories and reads an extract or two.

Embarking on up to fifteen dive trips each year during two decades, it was inevitable that he would find himself in close company of sharks from time to time. In fact he has been carried away by sharks - literally! A 5m-long tiger shark once grabbed him and swam off with him in its jaws but he lived to tell the tale.

This and other tales are incorporated in his illustrated talk. Diving with Tropical Sharks when he discusses many of the different types of shark you might encounter in warmer waters and tells of another book of stories he's written and about to go into production.

John Bantin is from Great Britain.

Ross Lockwood
Ross grew up in the small Canadian town of Winfield, BC, where he developed a passion for science, engineering, and space exploration. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Honors Physics at the University of Alberta in 2008, and is finishing his PhD in Condensed Matter Physics (ED Note: aka Rocket Scientist). His enjoyment of exploration and photography extends into the u/w world as an active member of the scuba diving community, both as a diver and as an assistant scuba diving instructor. He was an executive for the University of Alberta's Scuba Club, where he introduced dozens of divers to the wonders of scuba.
For underwater explorers, the prospect of diving an unknown site gives rise to a mix of excitement and trepidation. Whether professionally or just as a hobby, scuba divers are upholding one of humanity's most fundamental traits: our drive to explore. Although the majority of scuba divers think about the sub-surface world, there are many of us who have our eyes on the sky, where Mars seems tantalizingly close. With projects attempting to send humans to the Red Planet as early as 2023, public interest is growing daily. While Mars offers the promise of a second home for humanity, the technical challenges of getting there and back again are on a scale humanity hasn't seen since humans first set foot on the Moon.
Space-exploration and scuba diving have much in common. Astronauts train for spacewalks in zero-buoyancy tanks, build their suits to withstand harsh changes in pressure and temperature, and use decompression chambers to enter the vacuum of space. Many of the technical challenges in space-exploration are similar to problems that scuba divers worldwide face. To solve these challenges, analog missions are being conducted around the world, replicating different environments and testing various aspects that will be critical to future missions.
The Hawaii Space Exploration Analog & Simulation (HI-SEAS) is one such study, situated on the desolate lava fields of the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii, and I was among the few who have lived through a simulated 120-day surface mission to MARS.

Ross Lockwood lives in Edmonton working on his PHD at the U of A.

Charlene Barker

I am a part of an amazing team of 10 women that embarked on a very exciting proof of concept this summer called Team Sedna (named after Sedna, a mythological Inuit sea goddess). Susan Eaton, the team leader had a dream to snorkel across the Northwest Passage. I will be talking about the challenges that we faced and are still facing to make this dream happen.
During the "proof of concept mission, I was in charge of logistics. That doesn't really tell you what my actual function was but I must say, that the reality of it seemed like a dream. I was brought to the team with a strong background in scuba diving & equipment tech (owner/operator Aqua Sport Scuba in Calgary for over 20 years). What I did not bring with me was experience in snorkeling.
Join me early on Saturday am, while I tell you why this expedition was an interesting change from my norm.
